The species distribution suggests frequent horizontal gene transfer.  In a type 1 system, as characterised for the plasmid-encoded E coli hok/sok system, the toxin-encoding stable mRNA encodes a protein which rapidly leads to cell death unless the translation is suppressed by a short-lived small RNA. The plasmid-encoded module prevents the growth of plasmid-free offspring, thus ensuring the persistence of the plasmid in the population. Plasmid-free cells arising after cell-division will be killed because the stable mRNA toxin is present while the comparably unstable anti-toxin is rapidly degraded. Where the system is transcribed chromosomally, the mechanism is poorly understood [1].",
